I love biking, and it's pretty much the only sort of exercise that I've been able to commit to consistently. I'm nowhere near a professional, but I try to get out and ride every weekday with the goal of riding at least 30 miles a week. To track my effort -- and keep myself honest! -- I built a little integration with [Strava](https://strava.com) to track my rides.

At the moment I'm riding a [Trek Dual Sport+ 2](https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/hybrid-bikes/electric-hybrid-bikes/dual-sport/dual-sport-2/p/35854), a hybrid e-bike which uses a small electric motor behind the disc brakes to provide pedal assistance. The trails in Raleigh are fantastic, and we live less than a mile from a trailhead, but there are a lot of hills and I'm nowhere near fit enough to climb them. The help from the motor is just enough to smooth out the ride and make it a lot more fun.
