**Hi, I'm Nate**. I'm a software engineer and occasionally an entrepreneur.

Right now, I'm building [Ardent](https://ardent.ai), a platform which helps everyone build and share AI-powered software, whether or not they know how to write code. Before that, I spent a few years at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), working on developer experience and some of the company's [early work with generative AI](https://openai.com/customer-stories/stripe).

I've been [writing software](/work) since I was nine, and somehow I've managed to convince people to pay me to do so for the last {% duration since="2004-06-01" /%}. For most of my career, I've been focused on building software that helps people become more efficient and happier at work. I've built dozens of products, and even shipped a few of them. I've founded three companies, and [sold one](/writing/take-the-money-and-run).

I'm originally from [Akron, Ohio](/writing/the-city-of-opportunity). Now I live in Raleigh, North Carolina with [Niki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikikohari), my wife of {% duration since="2006-06-09" /%}, and our two sons Apollo ({% duration since="2018-10-09" /%} old) and Fox ({% duration since="2021-03-02" /%} old).

You can read more about what I'm doing [right now](/now). If you'd like to chat, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nkohari), [GitHub](https://github.com/nkohari), or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nkohari), or if you're feeling retro, [send me an email](mailto:hello@nate.io).
