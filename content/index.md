**Hi, I'm Nate**. I'm a software engineer, and occasionally an entrepreneur.

Right now, I'm building [Ardent](https://ardent.ai), a platform which helps users blend the creativity of generative AI with the determinism of software, with the goal of helping anyone write software regardless of whether or not they know how to code.

Before that, I spent a few years at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), working on developer experience, knowledge management, and some of the company's [early work with generative AI](https://openai.com/customer-stories/stripe).

I've been [writing software](/work) since I was nine years old, and somehow I've managed to convince people to pay me to do so for the last {% duration since="2004-06-01" /%}. For most of my career, I've been focused on building software that helps people become more efficient and happier at work. I've built dozens of products, and even shipped a few of them. I've founded three companies, and [sold one](/writing/take-the-money-and-run).

I'm originally from [Akron, Ohio](/writing/the-city-of-opportunity). Now I live in Raleigh, North Carolina with my wife [Niki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikikohari) and our two sons (one {% duration since="2018-10-01" /%} old, and one {% duration since="2021-03-01" /%} old).

You can read more about what I'm doing [right now](/now). If you'd like to chat, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nkohari), [GitHub](https://github.com/nkohari), or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nkohari), or if you're feeling retro, [send me an email](mailto:hello@nate.io).
