{% lead-in %}Hi, I'm Nate.{% /lead-in %} I'm a software engineer, and occasionally an entrepreneur.

I've been [writing software](/work) since I was nine years old, and somehow I've managed to convince people to pay me to do so for the last {% duration since="2004-06-01" /%}. For most of my career, I've been focused on building software that helps people become more efficient and happier at work. I've built dozens of products, and even shipped a few of them. I've founded three companies, and [sold one](/writing/take-the-money-and-run).

Right now, I'm building [Ardent](https://ardent.ai), a platform which helps users blend the creativity of generative AI with the determinism of software. Before that, I spent a few years at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), working on developer experience, knowledge management, and some of the company's [early work with generative AI](https://openai.com/customer-stories/stripe).

I'm originally from [Akron, Ohio](/writing/the-city-of-opportunity). Now I live in Raleigh, North Carolina with my wife [Niki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikikohari), our two sons (one {% duration since="2018-10-01" /%} old, and one {% duration since="2021-03-01" /%} old), and our {% duration since="2025-08-30" pluralize=false /%} old dapple dachshund Poppy.

I love retrofuturism and cyberpunk, and my favorite book is William Gibson's _Neuromancer_. I really enjoy videogames, and I especially love SNES-era classics like _Final Fantasy VI_, _Super Metroid_, and _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_. My favorite television show is _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_.

You can read more about what I'm doing [right now](/now). If you'd like to chat, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nkohari), [GitHub](https://github.com/nkohari), or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nkohari), or if you're feeling retro, [send me an email](mailto:hello@nate.io).
