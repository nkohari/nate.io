There's a lost art of storytelling in rock music. It's still pretty common in country music songs, but the problem there is that you would have to _listen to country music_.

At least in their earlier days, Cold War Kids was the exception. Each of their songs told an interesting story through the lyrics.

[Robbers and Cowards](https://open.spotify.com/album/1LTbo93CjLo48yNP8Ysaz5), their first LP, is arguably a [perfect album](/music/miike-snow/silvia), although it kind of peters out in the last few tracks. It's packed full of Cold War Kids' brand of storytelling, with off-kilter composition and a backdrop of wonky percussion.

The breakout single was [Hang Me Up To Dry](https://open.spotify.com/track/3IXRdLsQib8m0hBbQpe7T8), featuring the sound of an old clothes wringer in the background. But, my favorite track from the album is probably the opener, _We Used To Vacation_, which tells the story of a struggling alcoholic trying to do right by his family despite the pressure of normal life.

Also excellent are [Saint John](https://open.spotify.com/track/6WdGnAq6FFe7xUVnKMSAAb), about how an inmate ended up on death row, and [Passing The Hat](https://open.spotify.com/track/7laPfNKa9DVOJ63C7k9fV5), about the morality of stealing from the church.
