I was introduced to electronic music during high school. I don't remember what year it was, but I remember hanging out online with some IRC friends during Christmas break.

In between rounds of Quake 2 deathmatch, we talked a lot about music. At the time, I was into fairly mainstream radio-friendly alt-rock, but they were fans of something totally different they called _techno_.

Over the next few months, I grew to love [trance](/music/paul-van-dyk/for-an-angel), [big beat](/music/the-prodigy/voodoo-people), and house music, and began what would become a multi-decade obsession with Daft Punk.

I was heartbroken when they [called it quits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuDX6wNfjqc), but it was a long journey from [Homework](https://open.spotify.com/album/5uRdvUR7xCnHmUW8n64n9y) to [Random Access Memories](https://open.spotify.com/album/4m2880jivSbbyEGAKfITCa), with the brilliant symphonic [Tron Legacy](https://open.spotify.com/album/4US3nmuLIKELhVZdBPiKxx) soundtrack on the way.

If there was a Beatles of electronic music, it would be Daft Punk. They're easily one of the greatest, if not the greatest of all time.
