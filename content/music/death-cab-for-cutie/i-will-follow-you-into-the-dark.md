During college in the early 2000s, I really loved emo music. I was more into the [upbeat, punk-influenced](/music/jimmy-eat-world/bleed-american) end of the genre, but you can't like emo and not like Death Cab.

I know that some people think emo is too cheesy, and I get that. But, it's really tough to dispute that _I Will Follow You into the Dark_ is one of the saddest and sweetest songs ever written.

I confess that even as a middle-aged man, if this song comes on the radio, it's 50/50 that I'm going to be crying by the end.

I mean, you're just sitting around listening to the alt-rock station, and then a simple little acoustic song starts playing, and Ben Gibbard hits you with the opening lines:

> Love of mine  
> Someday you will die

Well shit Ben, now you have my attention.

> If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied  
> Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs  
> If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks  
> Then I'll follow you into the dark

A transcendental love, beyond life and death, beyond heaven and hell? Giving up your mortal soul to keep your lover company after they die? You can't get more emo than this.
