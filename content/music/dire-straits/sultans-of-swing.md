_Sultans of Swing_ is the song that makes you want to learn how to play guitar. Mark Knopfler plays the outro on his Stratocaster, and you're just like, "damn, maybe I should switch careers and become a guitarist. I still have time!"

The song is originally from their [self-titled debut](https://open.spotify.com/album/4dKdxly4ji1vfl7sEYuqBe). My Dad had the album on vinyl, and I used to wear out our old turntable playing it. [Down to the Waterline](https://open.spotify.com/track/0NnuQYRXNIzncgftfbTV3P), the opening track, is also one of my favorites.

But, I think Dire Straits is more interesting when you take a step back and look at their entire catalog. Their sound is really eclectic, especially for 80s rock.

This comes through on their greatest hits album, where the 8 minute storytelling ballad [Tunnel of Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/06ku5BBS2HufqSDVkcSR15) leads into [Private Investigations](https://open.spotify.com/track/0SqUwlygrVkMWkplNvvld1), which leads into [Twisting By the Pool](https://open.spotify.com/track/3LvReQ0qT9l7TeoXOLX50V).

Occasionally weird and varied over the years, but always interesting. And no matter what, Knopfler is there with his Strat, making you second-guess your choices in life. The best part is that he knows it --- he even wrote [a song about it](https://open.spotify.com/track/1E8qiEnaCzyiOicYsabbtX).
