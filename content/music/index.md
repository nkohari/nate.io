title: The Music That Made Me
---

I can't play any musical instruments, and I couldn't carry a tune to save my life, but listening to music has always been an important part of who I am. The music a person likes says a lot about them, and everyone has a handful of songs that are interesting or meaningful to them.

Here are a few of mine, and I'll add more as time goes on.
