This isn't one of Sam Beam's better-known songs, but when I randomly stumbled on it, it quickly became one of my favorites.

Sam's songs are always wistful and nostalgic, and a lot of them are about getting older and remembering things past. Perfect for someone who's staring down middle age.

_Autumn Town Leaves_ is a song about growing old, and seeing everyone around you become restless, but being content with what you have.

It's about knowing and focusing on what's really meaningful in life, which --- like most people, I think! --- is something I've always struggled with.
