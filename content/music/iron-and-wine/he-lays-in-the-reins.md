Iron & Wine is one of my favorite artists, as I've [mentioned before](/music/iron-and-wine/autumn-town-leaves). By himself, Sam Beam is a fantastic singer-songwriter, but his music is usually --- [but not always!](/music/iron-and-wine/walking-far-from-home) --- stripped-down and simple.

On _In The Reins_, he's paired with Calexico, who have a pretty unique "southwestern" sound that's heavily influenced by Mexican music like mariachi and tejano. The two acts come together to create a whole new sound, something more than Sam's indie folk, but not quite Calexico's Tex-Mex style either.

The album mostly features Sam on guitar and vocals, with Calexico as his backing band. This is another [perfect album](/music/miike-snow/silvia), and even though it's just a seven-track EP, it's still hard to choose one track to talk about.

As the opening track, _He Lays In The Reins_ showcases the style of the album immediately, and even has a Spanish verse from Calexico's Salvador Duran. (Listen closely to the percussion for the gallop, too!)

[16, Maybe Less](https://open.spotify.com/track/1CpfNazHmTtuz2lbrE4Bvm) is also one of my favorite songs of all time. Like a lot of Iron & Wine songs, it's about becoming an adult and missing the innocence of childhood love.
