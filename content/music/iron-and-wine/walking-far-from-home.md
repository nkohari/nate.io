I've been a fan of Iron & Wine (the stage name for Sam Beam) for a long time. He's experimented with different styles, but has mostly stayed true to an indie folk sound.

But _Walking Far From Home_ defies all categorization. It's got an unconventional structure, with no chorus or verses. It starts with a simple pad, and the composition gradually builds and changes, adding elements like synthesizers, reinforcing the feeling of traveling on a long journey.

In particular, I love the lines:

> I saw sickness, blooming fruit trees  
> I saw blood, and a bit of it was mine  
> I saw children in a river  
> But their lips were still dry, lips were still dry

One of the things I really like about Iron & Wine is that the lyrics are often intentionally obtuse, letting the listener apply their own interpretation. _Walking Far From Home_ is probably the best example of this --- each line in the song is an opportunity to ask yourself what Sam meant, and what it means to you.
