I love almost all kinds of music. I say _almost_ because I absolutely can't stand country music. It's formulaic, more generic than bubblegum pop, and so often just plain cringey. _Bleh._

But then there's Jason Isbell, and a little song called _Elephant_.

It's a simple song which tells a story of a man watching a woman he cares about die slowly and helplessly from cancer. Even though he's there for her and she's surrounded by friends and family, ultimately she's dying alone.

There's one line that's especially powerful:

> There's one thing that's real clear to me  
> No one dies with dignity

Everyone has a story about cancer, and everyone struggles with the idea of death. _Elephant_ is about how we all try to ignore our existential dread and enjoy what time we have.
