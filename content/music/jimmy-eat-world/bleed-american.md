Alt-rock was where it was at during the 90s, and during college, I found a new love for pop-punk and emocore.

I have fond memories of driving around in my shitty Grand Am with the radio blasting [Sugarcult](https://open.spotify.com/track/6SlYsxvOXnB5sNg6ltf7pX), [Yellowcard](https://open.spotify.com/track/23oxJmDc1V9uLUSmN2LIvx), [Eve 6](https://open.spotify.com/track/4tgeQrPu5xkrnwErym2JsJ) and [Boys Like Girls](https://open.spotify.com/track/56Tl3UgyZTqfZtvFNS31wm) --- at least, before they turned into a country outfit.

But, if I had to pick a single band which defined the _college sound_, it'd be Jimmy Eat World. I'll never not sing along to _Bleed American_.
