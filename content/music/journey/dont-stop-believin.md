I absolutely _love_ 80s music. There's just this carefree feeling about it that makes it an instant mood booster. Maybe it's nostalgia, but I was born in 1982, so I was pretty young when the stuff was originally in rotation.

Journey had a tremendous run between [Infinity](https://open.spotify.com/album/7K4Nk5fHkCuzNm5A6mdo2U) in 1978 and [Frontiers](https://open.spotify.com/album/2EFUNYmwxe0AOGxBORrfaw) in 1983, and I'd argue that they had a large part in inventing the sound of pop rock throughout the decade.

To be honest, I should probably include most of Journey's discography on this list. It's hard to disagree that they're in the top echelon of 80s pop rock.

As the opening track of Frontiers, _Don't Stop Believin'_ was by far their most popular song, but between it and [Open Arms](https://open.spotify.com/track/2w4EpqGasrz9qdTwocx54t) they could never repeat the magic.

There are two kinds of people in the world: those who admit to belting out _"streetlights, people, ahh ahh ahh ahhhhhhh!"_ during the chorus, and lying liars that sit on thrones of lies.
