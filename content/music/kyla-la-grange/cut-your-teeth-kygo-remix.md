The [original version](https://open.spotify.com/track/7Mc5iNnOyVtdsaHoFMO44B) of this track is also fantastic, but this is one of those rare occasions where a remix is better than the original.

Kyla La Grange's music is beautifully gentle, haunting and ethereal. In this remix, Kygo's distinctive [tropical house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_house) sound works so well to balance the spookiness of Kyla's vocals.

Trop house is like a bizzare mixture made of equal parts deep house and new wave. It's downtempo, but still bright and dancy. It's like someone said, "You know [Africa](https://open.spotify.com/track/2374M0fQpWi3dLnB54qaLX) by Toto? Let's make that into something we can dance to."

I'm already [on the record](/music/journey/dont-stop-believin) about how much I love 80s music, so you can see why this sort of thing appeals to me. For more trop house, check out [Matoma](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4YXycRbyyAE0wozTk7QMEq), especially his _(filthy)_ mega-mashup of old school 90s rap, [Old Thing Back](https://open.spotify.com/track/6HTJZ0TQJVMSKkUGzAOe2h).
