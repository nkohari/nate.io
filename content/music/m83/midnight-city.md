After we [sold our first startup](/writing/take-the-money-and-run), things went sideways for all sorts of reasons. Over the two years that I worked for the acquiring company, I lost myself in a pretty deep depression.

I didn't really notice it at the time, but it was like the world gradually turned grey around me.

In 2011, _Midnight City_ started getting a lot of airtime on indie radio stations. For whatever reason, the song found me at the right time, as the clouds that had hung over me for so long began to part. I listened to it over and over for weeks.

Really, it's just a catchy little song with a fun hook. But every time I listen to it, it's a reminder to take a look around make sure I can still see the world in color.
