My friends and I often debate about _perfect albums_, the elusive and incredibly rare collection where there's no filler, and each track is great.

I'd argue that Miike Snow's self-titled debut is a perfect album, and honestly it's hard to choose a favorite track. [Animal](https://open.spotify.com/track/1uxdxSC2bfUFYVqxvejVC3) is the one that got the most rotation, but for me it's a close tie between [Song for No One](https://open.spotify.com/track/15JHH5FBawCL7DmCcUxlUp) and _Silvia_.

A lot of Miike Snow's songs are layered thick with synthesizers and piano, but _Silvia_ is comparatively stripped-down. It's haunting and atmospheric, like wandering the city late at night, then building into an explosion of synths and autotune during the bridge, and again during the outro.

I love music that bends the boundaries between genres, and Miike Snow manages to effortlessly blend rock music with electro house. Their later work is also great, but their debut album is a unicorn.
