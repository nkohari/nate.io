I'm usually not a big fan of live recordings. I enjoy live music, but _recordings_ of live music always strike me as someone telling you how great the party was last week, and how you _totally_ should have been there because it was _so much fun_.

_Golden_ is the exception that proves the rule. My Morning Jacket's music is usually more complex, but _Golden_ is just Jim James on stage by himself with an acoustic guitar.

I first heard the song right after my wife and I took the leap to start our first company, and there's a particular verse that was powerful to me:

> And you you always told me  
> No matter how long it holds me  
> If it falls apart  
> Or makes us millionaires  
> You'll be right here forever  
> We'll go thru this thing together  
> And on heaven's golden shore we'll lay our heads

Whenever I thought we'd made a huge mistake and took too big a risk, _Golden_ would remind me that it didn't matter, because we were in it together.

A fun fact about the album: _Acoustic Citsuoca_ was supposedly recorded live at a single performance in Braintree, MA back in 2003. The only problem is that the venue doesn't exist, and there was no such concert.
