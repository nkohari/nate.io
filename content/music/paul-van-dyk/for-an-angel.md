I fell in love with trance music during high school in the late 90s, and like lots other people, Paul van Dyk was my gateway drug. His breakthrough hit, _For an Angel_, was an instant classic, and saw some pretty heavy Winamp rotation back in the day.

As the name suggests, trance is intended to put you into, well, a trance. I used to fall asleep to it, and it's great focus music.

Trance is especially interesting because of how little emphasis it puts on vocals. With most genres of music, vocals are the centerpiece, with the music supporting them. When trance does include vocals, they're positioned more as just another instrument in the composition rather than the leading act.

_For an Angel_ is a great example of this. Its lyrics are composed of literally one word, _angel_. Everything else is synths and pads and drums.

Trance is best enjoyed in performance sets mixed by DJs. If you're interested, check out [A State of Trance](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Ps64TVbfmfX6jxWJnlX1j) from Armin van Buuren and [Group Therapy](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7HXnQUEKHiWvUqSIR9ydOC) from Above & Beyond.
