[Irresistible Bliss](https://open.spotify.com/album/6xAjzeZbweRlhOz2KTJz3u) was the first album I bought on compact disc, back in the halcyon days of yore, when we listened to music enscribed upon little spinny-windy things instead of having it _beamed through the fucking sky_ to the supercomputer we jam into our pants every morning.

Soul Coughing was one of my favorite bands in the mid-90s. There's never been an act quite like them. It's a primordial ooze of jangly percussion and weird synth sounds layered on top of Mike Doughty's chanty beat-poetry vocals. It's fascinating, really weird, and super catchy.

After the band broke up in the early noughts, I somehow became convinced that Mike Doughty died of a heroin overdose. I guess I read something about him struggling with addiction during the Soul Coughing days, and my brain decided he had died? I don't know.

A few years ago, I was talking with some friends about Soul Coughing and how sad I was that Doughty had died. One of my friends corrected me (that is, he called me a dumbass) and said that not only was he alive, but he had an entire catalog of solo music! It's like a mature and more mellowed-out version of Soul Coughing. Try out [Looking At the World from the Bottom of a Well](https://open.spotify.com/track/56h6pkbRvTRp2e4sgToSnN?si=1ab51ef3b12f4323).

I love this album so much, but the question needs to be asked: what the hell is going on with the cover art?
