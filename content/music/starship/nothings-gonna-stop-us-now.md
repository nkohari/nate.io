Yes, I'm serious.

I unironically love Starship. Ask my friends --- I've spent hours defending them and their music.

I know the band is widely hated and [We Built This City](https://open.spotify.com/track/6OnfBiiSc9RGKiBKKtZXgQ) is widely considered [the worst song of all time](https://www.gq.com/story/oral-history-we-built-this-city-worst-song-of-all-time). I'm not even say I disagree with the premise. For this kind of corporate music to come from the dead corpse of a band like Jefferson Airplane, it's almost unholy.

But as a kid, this song was on the radio every fucking minute of the day, and I loved it. Yeah, it's like squeezing a can of Cheez Whiz directly into your ears, but what you have to understand is that when I was a kid, I loved Cheez Whiz.

Part of why I love [music from the 80s](/music/journey/dont-stop-believin) is that so often it doesn't take itself very seriously. Maybe it's just that everyone was too coked-out to realize how cheesy everything was, or maybe they just didn't give a shit. Either way, I can't get enough.
