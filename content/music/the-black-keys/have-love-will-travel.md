_Have Love Will Travel_ was originally [a doo-wop song](https://open.spotify.com/track/6EbmmL79iDxHrnduYQDBek) written by Richard Berry back in 1959. Then, in 1965, The Sonics [covered it](https://open.spotify.com/track/2uXkW8uJcOIhlbUatEPLPs) with a raw proto-punk garage version.

But in 2001, Dan Auerbach cranked the feedback knob on his guitar to 11, Patrick Carney set up a shitty eight-track recorder in his basement, and together they made the song their own.

If I had to choose one "favorite" band, it'd be The Black Keys. They're [also from Akron](/writing/the-city-of-opportunity), and their mix of raw, gritty, bluesy rock is just right. Way back, they'd do shows at the [Civic Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron_Civic_Theatre), and my biggest musical regret is not seeing them there when I had the chance.

Trying to come up with a name for the album, Dan and Patrick drove around Akron. Wandering into a Super K-Mart, they found a jar of pomade, and history was made.

Five Grammys later, they're a Very Big Deal, and have moved on to Nashville. They don't need to spend their advance on rent anymore, and can afford actual studio time.

Their sound is a lot more refined now, but underneath the studio gloss, you can still hear the shitty basement. You can take the band out of Akron, but you can't take Akron out of the band.
