I have to confess something: [Hackers](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film)>) is one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it in high school and was immediately obsessed. It's so terrible and cheesy and I love it so much.

One of the best things about _Hackers_ is the soundtrack. I saw the movie right around the same time I was [introduced to electronic music](/music/daft-punk/around-the-world), and along with the ridiculous fashion, the music was a big part of why I enjoyed it.

That, and I might have had a little crush on pixie-cut Angelina Jolie. It's also surprisingly progressive (even kinky!) for a PG-13 teen action flick from the 90s.

Anyways, I'm supposed to be talking about The Prodigy. They're fucking fantastic. They're the godfathers of [big beat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_beat), and their unique blend of punk and electronic music presses all the right buttons for me. You've probably heard of them.

The Prodigy's breakthrough hits came with their follow-up, [The Fat of the Land](https://open.spotify.com/album/2qivROlvQ8BcUKTaCA7dL2?si=7E9cH2ofTnS5QxWSXB8EXg), but for me, when _Voodoo People_ played during the hacking montage, I was hooked. After all, if Acid Burn liked them, they had to be good.
