In the early 90s, I started getting very interested in music, and U2 was the first band that I was obsessed with. [Achtung Baby](https://open.spotify.com/album/0ta5VdkJcpdVnNrn7g4cZe) had just come out, and the singles were playing nonstop on the radio. I started there, and worked backwards.

U2 was the first time I bought a band's entire catalog on CD. I also managed to find vinyl copies of [War](https://open.spotify.com/album/6GaqU0TlYBKHUiSJ0AT9A2) and [The Unforgettable Fire](https://open.spotify.com/album/4JfQDfKe4N5NCEyMP1mYT6) at a garage sale, but they were too beat up to listen to. Instead, I hung them on my bedroom wall, where they stayed until I moved out.

Gradually, I've outgrown U2, and I don't listen to them much anymore. Maybe it was just my tastes changing, but I think their last good album was [Pop](https://open.spotify.com/album/5mojJwWgWNJcY3odUGgQc3), and things went downhill quickly after that. I remember getting a copy of [All That You Can't Leave Behind](https://open.spotify.com/album/7gskILm9UyDvFlmmAoqn2g) for Christmas in 2000, and it was the first album that I was really disappointed with.

By the time they got to the cringefest _uno-dos-tres-catorce_ opening in [Vertigo](https://open.spotify.com/track/1gVVSmhWjci8l9Vrsl6HaS) and started forcibly installing their albums on everyone's Apple devices, I'd moved on.
