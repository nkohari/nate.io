title: What I'm Doing Now
---

Here are some things I'm focused on right now:

- Spinning up the new Developer AI team at Stripe. We have so many ideas, and it'll take some experimentation before we can transform them into a reasonable roadmap.
- Reading an absurd amount of papers about LLMs and code generation. I may also be asking [Claude](https://claude.ai) to explain some of it to me. :)
- Learning how to write in public again. Man, it's hard. I've written a bunch at work, but I haven't written anything intended for public consumption for years.
- [Riding my bike](/biking), and gradually getting stronger again after not riding for several years. I've been aiming for 30 miles a week, but not quite hitting my goal.
- Tinkering with Apocrypha, the engine that powers this site. It's kind of like [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/), but for [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev). There are still a whole bunch of rough edges that need polishing, but it's probably at a point where I can release it.
- Playing Starfield!
