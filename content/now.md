title: What I'm Doing Now
---

Here are some things I'm focused on right now:

- Experimenting with ways of using generative AI (mainly LLMs) to improve Stripe's developer experience. Because of the massive amount of hype around AI, I was skeptical, but after some tinkering I've found some great ways to apply it to solve real problems.
- [Riding my bike](/biking), and gradually getting stronger again after not riding for several years.
- I finished Tears of the Kingdom, which was excellent. It wasn't quite as good as Breath of the Wild, but it was definitely a worthy sequel. I'm now leveling my sorceress in Diablo 4. (Ice shards, obviously.)
