title: What I'm Doing Now
---

Here are some things I'm focused on right now:

- I built a new computer with an RTX 4090 so I can experiment with some open source LLMs. I'm especially interested in [Mixtral 8x7B](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/), even if I have to use a quantized version of it to jam it into 24GB of VRAM.
- Playing Cyberpunk 2077 again. And again. And again. The new 2.0 patch (along with Phantom Liberty) is absurdly good. I actually had a pretty good experience during launch (playing on a PC with a GTX 3070) but the game was obviously unfinished. The 2.0 release fixed so many nagging issues and really lets the game shine.
- Desperately trying to avoid getting sick anymore. Our oldest son is in preschool, and at least one person has been sick in our house for the last 8 weeks.
