title: What I'm Doing Now
---

Here are some things I'm focused on right now:

- Sharpening my saw when it comes to writing, both personally and professionally. I used to really enjoy writing, but I've neglected it quite a bit for awhile.
- Looking for more opportunities for mentorship. I'm really energized by helping other engineers with anything from software architecture to career pathing.
- Experimenting with static analysis, transformation, and generation of [Markdoc](https://markdoc.io) ASTs.
- I managed to get a PS5, so I've dived into Elden Ring. I'm only a couple of hours in, but so far it's as impressive as people say.
- Waiting impatiently for the last six episodes of Better Call Saul, but if they kill off Kim I'm going to be inconsolable for days.
