title: What I'm Doing Now
---

Here are some things I'm focused on right now:

- Sharpening my saw when it comes to writing, both personally and professionally. I used to really enjoy writing, but I've largely neglected it for a long time.
- Looking for more opportunities for mentorship. I'm really energized by helping other engineers with anything from software architecture to career pathing.
- Experimenting with static analysis, transformation, and generation of [Markdoc](https://markdoc.io) ASTs.
- Replaying Breath of the Wild and working towards 100% completion. Probably won't collect all the damn Korok seeds, though.
- Waiting impatiently for the last six episodes of Better Call Saul, but if they kill off Kim I'm going to be inconsolable for days.
