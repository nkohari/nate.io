title: What I'm Doing Now
---

Here are some things I'm focused on right now:

- Experimenting with ways of using generative AI (mainly LLMs) to improve Stripe's developer experience. Because of the massive amount of hype around AI, I was extremely skeptical, but after some tinkering I've found some really great ways to apply it to solve real problems.
- Playing Tears of the Kingdom. I still have quite a few shrines to finish, but at this point, I'm really just procrastinating finishing the main storyline.

This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. You can create one too!
