title: What I'm Doing Now
---

Here are some things I'm focused on right now:

- Building the first version of [Ardent](https://ardent.ai). More on that soon!
- Playing a bunch of [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/). It's such a simple, straightforward, but deceptively deep and complex game. It's like poker... but not poker? You just have to try it to understand.

This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. You can create one too!
