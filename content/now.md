title: What I'm Doing Now
---

Here are some things I'm focused on right now:

- Tinkering with this website! It's the first time I've shipped something with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), and I'm really loving the development experience.
- Learning more about web animation. I used to be much more of a frontend developer, but I've been more focused on systems and architecture lately.
- Sharpening my saw when it comes to writing, both personally and professionally. I used to really enjoy writing, but I've neglected it for awhile.
- Experimenting with static analysis, transformation, and generation of [Markdoc](https://markdoc.io) ASTs. There's so much potential here! We've been using Markdoc at Stripe for a couple of years now, but I think we're still just scratching the surface of what can be done.

This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. You can create one too!
