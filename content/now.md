title: What I'm Doing Now
---

Here are some things I'm focused on right now:

- Building the first version of [Ardent](https://ardent.ai). We've gone through a few different concepts as we navigate the idea maze, and I'm extremely excited about what we've landed on now.
- Playing [ARC Raiders](https://arcraiders.com/), a fantastic extraction shooter which doubles as a social experiment. I keep describing it as "prisoner's dilemma, the game." Highly recommended.

This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. You can create one too!
