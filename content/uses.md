title: My Tools & Gear
---

Sometimes I get questions about my equipment, and who doesn't love nerding out about their gear?

## Computer

* [MacBook Pro M3 Max](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro): 128GB RAM is probably overkill, but it runs local LLMs without breaking a sweat. The 14" form factor is portable, and plenty powerful when docked.
* [Dell UltraSharp U4025QW 40" 5K2K Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D1TX35MQ): I love ultrawide (21:9 or 21:10) monitors, but hate compromising on pixel density. This beast gives you both, plus a 120Hz refresh rate.
* [GMMK TKL Keyboard](https://www.gloriousgaming.com/): Tenkeyless is my favorite keyboard form factor.
* [Drop+biip extended 2048 keycaps](https://drop.com/buy/drop-biip-mt3-extended-custom-keycap-set): A little bit of vintage Mac vibes on a modern package, and I love the taller MT3 profile.

## Desk

* [Uplift V2 Commercial Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/uplift-v2-standing-desk-v2-or-v2-commercial/): Being able to press a button and stand up is a great way to switch up the energy and avoid sitting all day.
* [Herman Miller Embody Chair](https://store.hermanmiller.com/office-chairs-ergonomic-chairs/embody-chair/4737.html): Herman Miller chairs are the best of the best. My Embody replaced an original Mirra which lasted over a decade of daily use before the armrest finally gave out. (For bonus points, replace the stock casters with [rollerblades](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CTIG4GE)!)

## Audio / Visual

* [Sony Alpha ZV-E10](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilczve10-b): A great all-around mirrorless camera. Since I have it mounted, the flip-out screen is great.
* [Sigma 23mm F1.4 DC DN Lens](https://www.sigma-global.com/en/lenses/c023_23_14/): This lens has a super wide f/1.4 aperture, creating a really nice bokeh effect.
* [Shure MV7](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/mv7?variant=MV7%252B-K): A great little mic. Lightweight, easy to use via USB, and sounds great.
* [Elgato CamLink 4K](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/cam-link-4k): This little guy lets me capture 4K@30FPS, which is plenty for what I need.
* [Elgato Key Light](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/key-light): This counterbalances the natural light in my office so I don't look like Two Face.
* [Elgato Wave Mic Arm LP](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/wave-mic-arm-lp): This low-profile mount is perfect to swing the mic into place when I'm on a call, then swing it back out of sight afterwards.
* [Apple AirPods Max](https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/): Great daily-driver headphones. They're not the best in any category, but they're the best all-around package. (I also use regular AirPods for meetings.)

## Home

* [Ubiquiti UniFi](https://ui.com): Ubiquiti's prosumer networking and camera equipment can't be beat. It's got a pretty sizable barrier to entry, but it's well worth adopting.
* [Sonos](https://sonos.com/): I used to be a huge Sonos fan until the app debacle of 2024. It's still a great system, but they need to re-earn my trust before I can recommend them again.
* [Philips Hue](https://philips-hue.com/): Most bulbs in our house is a Hue bulb now. They're set to fade up in the morning, down in the evening, with a splash of color for fun.
* [Plex](https://plex.app): The frontend to our home media server, a ~64TB zfs pool which is home to a giant pile of ripped Blu-Rays and archived YouTube videos.

## Carry

* [Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max](https://www.apple.com/iphone/): I used to have both an iPhone and an iPad, but a single larger screen is the way to go. The camera is fantastic for grabbing quick memories of the kids.
* [Apple Watch Ultra](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-ultra-2/): I'm not climing K2, but I do love the more-rugged titanium design.
* [Peak Design 20L Everyday Backpack](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack?Size=20L&Color=Black): It's technically designed as a camera bag, but the dividers make it really versatile for carrying tech junk.
* [Anker 737 Power Bank](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VPHVT2Z): Plenty of power to recharge my iPhone, the kids' iPads, or even my MacBook in a pinch.

## Programming

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Highly controversial at launch, now almost a de-facto standard.
* [Supermaven](https://supermaven.com/): So much better than GitHub Copilot, it's like a superintelligent autocomplete. I continue to be shocked at how well the model can guess my intent.
* [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/): An impressively well-designed color scheme.
* [Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/): I've tried lots of different programming fonts, but I keep coming back to Recursive.
* [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com/): While I still prefer the more expressive Recursive for my IDE, for some reason I prefer Commit Mono for terminals.

## Apps

* [Mimestream](https://mimestream.com/): A fantastic Gmail-specific desktop mail app. So much better than the web UI.
* [Linear](https://linear.app): Project management software is near and dear to my heart, and this is probably as close to a JIRA-killer as there ever will be.
* [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/): Replaces the stock Spotlight popover with a unified launcher and lots more. I have it bound to a ⌘+SPACE chord.
* [MeetingBar](https://meetingbar.app/): Lives in your menubar, and is great for heads-up calendar reminders.
* [Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/): I've used this little window manager for years, and I'd be heartbroken if it stopped working.
