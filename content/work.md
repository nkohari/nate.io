{% lead-in %}I'm an internet engineer.{% /lead-in %} I build thoughtful, polished web interfaces and scalable, high-performance APIs. My goal as an engineer is to make people happier, more efficient, and more effective at their work.

Right now, I'm building [Ardent](https://ardent.ai), a platform which helps users blend the creativity of generative AI with the determinism of software, with the goal of helping anyone write software regardless of whether or not they know how to code.

Before that, I spent four and a half years at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) working on developer experience and some of the company's early work with generative AI. Over the {% duration since="2004-06-01" /%} of [my career](#career), I've started three companies, and held a wide range of roles from engineer to executive.

## My Principles

1. **Be better than yesterday.** Everything is a work-in-progress, including ourselves. If we gradually make [small improvements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) every day, they'll result in dramatic changes. The value of incremental and directionally-correct work compounds over time, just like interest on savings.
2. **Move with urgency and focus.** Good software that's in the user's hands always beats better software that's still in development. However, building the _wrong_ thing is much worse than building _nothing_ at all. Stay focused on the fundamentals, cut everything else, and deliver the rest incrementally.
3. **Opportunity requires optimism.** In order to see and seize opportunities, you have to believe that things will work out for the best over the long term. There will always be challenges to overcome, but believing that things will turn out badly is the surest way to fail.
4. **Maximize your leverage.** Work that makes other people more efficient, happier, or better at their jobs is the highest-impact work an engineer can do. Your own time and energy is limited; always be on the lookout for opportunities to amplify your effort.
5. **Feedback is a gift.** Every viewpoint is unique, and striving to understanding them is an opportunity for us to improve and better understand ourselves, our work, and the world around us. Give and receive feedback freely, as long as it's truthful, necessary, timely, and kind.
6. **Embrace impermanence.** Users don't care about software; they care about the impact it has on their lives and what it enables them to do. Avoid becoming attached to the code you write, and celebrate the day when it's replaced by something better.

## My Career {% #career %}

{% work from="2024" to="now" job="Founder of Ardent" location="remote from Raleigh, NC" %}
Building the world's easiest way for everyone to build and share AI-powered software, regardless of whether or not they know how to code.
{% /work %}

{% work from="2019" to="2024" job="Staff Software Engineer at Stripe" location="remote from Raleigh, NC" %}
I was the technical lead of Developer AI, applying generative AI to improve Stripe's developer experience. Some example projects include a bot that found errors in our code samples and suggested fixes, and a Q&A system which read Stripe's documentation and answered questions. (Everyone has one of these now! But ours was one of the first, and was [featured](https://openai.com/customer-stories/stripe) in the GPT4 launch announcement.)

Before that, I was the technical lead of the Docs organization, a cross-functional group of engineers, writers, and designers responsible for [Stripe's documentation](https://stripe.com/docs). I lead a multi-year effort to build a modern infrastructure for Stripe's docs powered by React and [Markdoc](https://markdoc.io), paying down years of technical debt and providing a ~4x speedup over the legacy system.

{% work from="2018" to="2019" job="Senior Software Engineer at Auth0" note="acq. Okta" location="remote from Raleigh, NC" %}
I was the frontend development lead for Extend, a serverless computing product that never made it out of private beta. After [it was discontinued](https://auth0.com/blog/we-are-sunsetting-extend/), I joined the Extensibility team to work on Webtask, the serverless infrastructure that allows Auth0's customers to extend the Auth0 platform using custom code.
{% /work %}

{% work from="2016" to="2018" job="Software Engineering Consultant" location="remote from Raleigh, NC" %}
I was a freelance consultant focused on React and Node.js. I delivered a bunch of different projects, including re-engineering a high-traffic documentation site, building a user analytics product end-to-end (including frontend, API, data warehouse, and ETL), and adding live real-time bidding to an ad server.
{% /work %}

{% work from="2014" to="2016" job="Co-Founder of TaskTorch" location="in Raleigh, NC" %}
I built TaskTorch, a SaaS work management application built using React, Node.js, and [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/). Unfortunately, we couldn't find sufficient traction and decided to scuttle the project after ~14 months.
{% /work %}

{% work from="2012" to="2014" job="Chief Technical Officer of Kevel" note="formerly Adzerk" location="in Durham, NC" %}
I led the development of an advertising API platform used by companies such as Reddit, Stack Overflow, and BitTorrent. I built a new ad server using Node.js, permitting the company to scale by ~30x, from 1 billion ads per month in 2012 to 1 billion ads per day in 2014. I also grew the team from 6 people to 14, including 6 engineers.
{% /work %}

{% work from="2010" to="2012" job="Engineering Manager at Rally Software" note="acq. Broadcom" location="in Raleigh, NC" %}
I was head of engineering for AgileZen, operating as a business unit within [Rally Software](https://rallydev.com/). I led the effort to build AgileZen 2.0, including a rewrite of large parts system using CoffeeScript and Node.js. I also grew the team from 2 people to 10, including 5 engineers.
{% /work %}

{% work from="2009" to="2010" job="Co-Founder of AgileZen" note="acq. Rally Software" location="in Akron, OH" %}
I built AgileZen, one of the first web-based kanban tools (like Trello, before Trello). We grew quickly after launch, with double-digit month-over-month growth in both users and revenue. After we [agreed to be acquired](/writing/take-the-money-and-run) by Rally Software in 2010, we began running AgileZen as a business unit within the company.
{% /work %}

{% work from="2008" to="2009" job="Senior Software Engineer at Telligent Systems" note="acq. Verint" location="remote from Akron, OH" %}
I contributed to [Community Server](https://community.telligent.com/), a white-labeled community platform which powered Microsoft's developer community forums and MSDN blogs.
{% /work %}

{% work from="2007" to="2008" job="Software Architect at CTI" location="in Akron, OH" %}
I built the frontend for [Accelerated Analytics](https://acceleratedanalytics.com), a SaaS business intelligence system built on top of Microsoft Reporting Services, and participated in the construction of data warehouses using Microsoft Analysis Services. I hired and mentored junior engineers, and provided architectural feedback and support on several projects for other teams.
{% /work %}

{% work from="2006" to="2007" job="Software Developer II at Merge Healthcare" note="acq. IBM" location="in Akron, OH" %}
I contributed to [FUSION RIS](https://www.ibm.com/products/merge-ris), an imaging product for radiologists. I built the Genesis Framework, a library which allowed new components built in C# to interact with existing legacy components built in VB6 using interfaces and dependency injection rather than working with COM interop directly.
{% /work %}

{% work from="2004" to="2006" job="Software Engineer at CTI" location="in Akron, OH" %}
I built Goodyear TireTracker, a logistics support system which tracked NASCAR racing tires through their lifecycle. Tire techs used handheld scanners running a custom .NET Compact Framework app to scan passive RFID chips embedded in the sidewalls of the tires. To allow it to be used at racetracks, the system was portable and designed to be eventually consistent, without requiring a stable wifi signal.
{% /work %}

I attended [The University of Akron](https://uakron.edu) with a full scholarship, and graduated summa cum laude in 2004 with a B.S. in Computer Science.
