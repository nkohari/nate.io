title: My Work
---

I've spent the last few years at later-stage startups. Before that, I spent most of my career working for smaller companies, or starting my own. I've held pretty much every position in software from engineer to executive, and also spent a few years as an independent consultant.

## Experience

{% work from="2019" to="now" job="Staff Software Engineer at Stripe" location="Raleigh, NC (Remote)" %}
Technical lead for the Docs organization, a cross-functional group of engineers, designers, and technical writers that is responsible for [Stripe's documentation](https://stripe.com/docs). Lead the development of a new platform for Stripe's docs powered by React and [Markdoc](https://markdoc.io), paying down years of technical debt and providing a ~4x speedup over the legacy system.

{% work from="2018" to="2019" job="Senior Software Engineer at Auth0" note="acq. Okta" location="Raleigh, NC (Remote)" %}

{% work from="2016" to="2018" job="Software Engineering Consultant" location="Raleigh, NC (Remote)" %}

{% /work %}

{% work from="2014" to="2016" job="Co-Founder of TaskTorch" location="Raleigh, NC" %}
Designed and developed TaskTorch, a SaaS work management application built using React, Node.js, and [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/). The system was a mashup between a project management system and email, where users would "pass" tasks to one another until they were complete. Raised $25K in local grant funding. Unfortunately, we couldn't find sufficient traction and scuttled the project after ~14 months.

{% work from="2012" to="2014" job="Chief Technical Officer of Kevel" note="formerly Adzerk" location="Durham, NC" %}
Led the development of an advertising API platform used by companies such as Reddit, Stack Overflow, and BitTorrent.

Grew the team from 6 people to 14, including 6 engineers.
{% /work %}

{% work from="2010" to="2012" job="Engineering Manager at Rally Software" note="acq. Broadcom" location="Raleigh, NC" %}

{% work from="2009" to="2010" job="Co-Founder of AgileZen" note="acq. Rally Software" location="Akron, OH" %}

Grew quickly after launch, with double-digit month-over-month growth in both users and revenue. [Acquired](/writing/take-the-money-and-run) by Rally Software in 2010, and began running AgileZen as a business unit within the company.

{% work from="2007" to="2008" job="Software Developer II at Merge Healthcare" note="acq. IBM" location="Akron, OH" %}
Contributed to [FUSION RIS](https://www.ibm.com/products/merge-ris), an imaging product for radiologists.

{% /work %}

{% work from="2007" to="2008" job="Software Engineer at CTI" location="Akron, OH" %}
Built Goodyear TireTracker, a logistics support system which tracked NASCAR racing tires through their lifecycle. Tire techs used handheld scanners running a custom .NET Compact Framework app to scan passive RFID chips embedded in the sidewalls of the tires. To allow it to be used at racetracks, the system was portable and designed to be eventually consistent, without requiring a stable wifi signal.
