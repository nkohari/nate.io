{% lead-in %}When I first graduated from college{% /lead-in %}, the job market was pretty bad, and most companies were cutting back rather than hiring new employees. A few months before I graduated, I sent out over 100 copies of my resume to various IT and software shops around the area. I got only one call back, and it was from CTI, where I've now worked for most of my career. They took a chance on me when I was greener than grass, and challenged me with some very interesting and difficult projects. I've learned a tremendous amount about software development and business in my time here, and while there have been ups and downs, the experience I've gained has been invaluable. However, a couple of months ago I decided that it was time for the company and I to part ways.

In May of this year, I met [Dan Hounshell](http://danhounshell.com/), [Joe Fiorini](http://www.faithfulgeek.org/), and [Leon Gersing](http://www.fallenrogue.com/) at the Cleveland Day of .NET, and Dan asked if I would be interested in applying for a position at [Telligent](http://telligent.com/). I've had a lot of respect for the company and followed the blogs and Twitter streams of several employees, and when he mentioned that they would consider people for telecommuting positions, my curiosity was piqued. At the time I hadn't made up my mind to leave my current job, but once I did I pinged Dan to see if they might have an opening for a ninja-obsessed codephile such as myself. :)

After going through their interview process (which was _very impressive_), I'm happy to announce that I've accepted a position on Telligent's Product Development Team as a Senior Software Development Engineer, starting at the beginning of September. The company is based in Dallas, Texas, but I'll be working remotely from my home in Ohio --- which should prove to be an interesting experience in and of itself. (Oddly enough, several of the people in Product Development that work remotely are in Ohio, although as far as I know, only Joe Fiorini is in the greater Cleveland area like myself.)

I'm very excited to be joining the team, and working on some very cool products with some of the industry's best and brightest minds!
