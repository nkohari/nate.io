{% lead-in %}July 1st came with a great surprise{% /lead-in %}, as I was named a [Microsoft C# MVP](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/) for 2009! If you’re not familiar with the award, here’s a blurb from their website:

> Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs) are exceptional technical community leaders from around the world who are awarded for voluntarily sharing their high quality, real world expertise in offline and online technical communities. Microsoft MVPs are a highly select group of experts that represents the technical community’s best and brightest, and they share a deep commitment to community and a willingness to help others.

Although it’s overshadowed a bit by my excitement about the imminent launch of [Zen](http://agilezen.com/), I’m thrilled to receive the award. Thank you to all the existing MVPs that nominated me, and congratulations to those who were renewed and other freshman MVPs, including [Mike Eaton](http://mjeaton.net/blog/), [John Stockton](http://riathoughts.com/), and [Sarah Dutkiewicz](http://codinggeekette.com/).

_(And yes, the title is a joke. Totally kidding.)_
