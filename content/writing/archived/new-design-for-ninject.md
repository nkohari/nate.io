I just launched the [Ninject site redesign](http://ninject.org/) that I've been working on for the past week or so. I was a half-assed web designer in a former life, so I dredged up a bit of my graphic design skills. Major thanks goes to Ike Allred of [Sibling Systems](http://www.siblingsystems.com/), who was nice enough to let me use his sweet ninja illustrations.

You'll also notice that there's a new [bug tracker](http://bugs.ninject.org/) and [wiki](http://dojo.ninject.org/) set up for Ninject. I'll be working over the next few weeks to move documentation to the wiki so the community can contribute. If you find bugs, or have feature requests, feel free to enter them in the tracker.

Anyhow, check out the site and let me know what you think!
