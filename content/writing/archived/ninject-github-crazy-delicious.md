Last weekend, I was talking with [Ivan Porto Carrero](http://flanders.co.nz/) about some work he’s doing on Ninject to add IronRuby support (which looks _friggin’ awesome_, by the way). He convinced me to finally sack up and try [GitHub](http://github.com/). I’d toyed with [Git](http://git-scm.com/) before, but I was always hung up on the ugliness of the tooling under Windows. Source control is not something that I want glued together with duct tape and chewing gum, and that was the initial impression I got from the tools.

Boy, was I wrong.

I’ve used Subversion for years, and the relative maturity of the tools lulls you into a false sense of comfort and get you to ignore the major issues with the underlying structure. While the Windows support for Git is kind of patched together, the tools themselves are _extremely intelligent_. The leap from Subversion to Git isn’t quite as big as the leap from VSS to Subversion was, but it’s definitely close. I’m now a complete Git convert, and I’ve even bought a commercial account on GitHub to move my closed-source work there also.

Anyhow, the source for Ninject 2 now has a [new home on GitHub](http://github.com/enkari/ninject/tree/master). This source tree will now represent the most-current version of the Ninject 2 source, and I’ll be removing the experimental branch from Subversion soon. The Ninject 1 source will remain in the Google Code repository for posterity. If you don’t want to bother with installing Git, you’ll always be able to grab a zip file of the latest Ninject source from:

If you’re interested in GitHub, Aaron Jensen just published [a great post](http://aaron.codebetter.com/blogs/aaron.jensen/archive/2009/03/12/hosting-your-oss-project-on-github.aspx) on hosting your projects there. I highly recommend you check it out.
