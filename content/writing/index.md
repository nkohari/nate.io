title: My Writing

I've been writing on various blogs and websites for the last {% duration since="2006-07-28" /%}. I don't
write as often as I used to, which is something I should probably work on.

## Articles from a past life

Lots of my older writing feels pretty silly to me today, and most of the content isn’t relevant anymore.
Reading these articles, I often don't recognize myself as the author. For some reason I can't part with
them, so instead I've marked them as _archived_ and included them here.
