{% lead-in %}My wife and I moved to Raleigh{% /lead-in %} in 2010 after we [sold our first company](/writing/take-the-money-and-run), but we were both born and raised in [Akron, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio), a fairly small Midwestern city an hour south of Cleveland.

Throughout the late 19th and most of the 20th century, Akron was a seat of industry. As the home to Goodyear, Firestone, B.F. Goodrich, and General Tire, it was the "rubber capital of the world." I grew up in a neighborhood called [Goodyear Heights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_in_Akron,_Ohio#Goodyear_Heights), which was originally built specifically to house Goodyear factory employees. My wife grew up in [Firestone Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_in_Akron,_Ohio#Firestone_Park). I attended [Seiberling Elementary School](https://seiberlingclc.akronschools.com/) (named for the founder of Goodyear), and later [Goodyear Middle School](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pyathia/sets/72157644726552273/).

You get the picture. Akron was a city built on rubber.

At its peak, two-thirds of the nation's tires were manufactured in Akron. Then, in the 1970s, as globalization took hold and industry left America, the city's rubber factories gradually shut down. Firestone was sold to Bridgestone, a Japanese company, and General Tire was acquired by Continental Tire, based from Germany. B.F. Goodrich phased out their tire production operations until finally leaving the business entirely in the mid-1980s.

Like his father before him, my father worked for years --- many of them on the night shift --- building tires at the B.F. Goodrich factory before it closed in 1987. He was 36 years old with two young children, and along with hundreds of other tirebuilders, his career was suddenly over.

In the years that followed, Akron became part of the [Rust Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_Belt), a wide and long swath of burned-out post-industrial towns that cuts through the American midwest from Detroit to Buffalo. My father was able to begin a new career, but many others weren't as fortunate.

The city has yet to recover, and 24% of Akronites live below the poverty line. During the 90s, the greater Akron area was the methamphetamine capital of Ohio. Then, after the turn of the century, Northeast Ohio was "ground zero" for the nation's opioid crisis.

I was too young to understand any of this at the time, and much to their credit, my parents were able to shield my sister and I from any of it. But when I grew a little older, it taught me how quickly the status quo can change, the value of a healthy distrust of authority, and the power of being in control of your own destiny. I'm also immensely proud of my dad to reinvent himself like he did.

Incidentally, the Black Keys --- who also hail from Akron --- recorded their album [Rubber Factory](https://open.spotify.com/album/1rlGDm1KQJfDyT5v1U8Xk5) in one of the abandoned factories, which gives it a raw, gritty vibe. Give it a listen; it sounds like the city.

In 2010, the factory where they recorded was demolished.

I was kind of a strange kid. I used to play with cardboard boxes, drawing complicated computers on them with a Sharpie, and sitting in front of them for hours pretending to press the buttons. The exact function of the imaginary machines is lost to my youth. Spaceships and stuff, no doubt? I dunno.

For Christmas in 1989, my grandfather bought us our first computer, a Tandy 1000 SX. Rather than spend a lot of money on games, my mom bought a book called [Basic Computer Games](http://www.amazon.com/BASIC-Computer-Games-Microcomputer-Edition/dp/0894800523), and painstakingly copied the source code from the book into the GW-BASIC interpreter.

I still vividly remember making the connection that the BASIC code from the book defined the rules of the game, and that by changing the code, I could change the rules. I could give myself the high score, make my character jump higher, whatever I wanted. I could tell the computer what to do. I was in control.

For an awkward kid not quite sure of himself, being in charge of a world --- even a tiny one living in a glowing box on the desk --- was empowering. Gradually, I taught myself to make more and more complex changes to the games, and a programmer was born.

A few years later, we got a new computer, a Packard Bell 386. Among its many upgrades was a dial-up modem. Rather than buy an (fairly expensive) subscription to AOL, my mom learned about a free BBS called called the Akron Regional Free-Net {% note #1 /%} that was maintained by the local library.

Through the Free-Net, I met some like-minded kids my age who were volunteering as admins. I volunteered as an admin myself, which got me direct access to the Solaris machines powering the Free-Net, allowing me to learn UNIX. It took some finagling with [SLIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Line_Internet_Protocol) settings, but eventually I figured out how to get past the Free-Net systems and onto the internet proper.

After that, I grew up on the internet. From our little house in Ohio, it was a window unto the wider world.

I graduated from high school in 2000, and began studying computer science at the [University of Akron](https://uakron.edu). I'd been accepted elsewhere, but Akron offered me a full scholarship, and it was difficult to turn down that kind of offer.

After graduating, I had a lot of trouble finding my first job as an engineer. There aren't a lot of software companies in Akron, and there were even fewer back in 2004. In desperation, I grabbed our copy of the Yellow Pages, I printed a few dozen copies of my résumé, and mailed one to every company in the city that sounded like it had something to do with software or IT.

I got one call back.

It was from a company called [Commercial Timesharing](https://comtime.com), which was founded back in the 70s to sell timeshares of processing time on minicomputers. {% note #2 /%} And, in true Akron form, their main product was a control system for tire testing machines.

I took the job because it was the only opportunity I had, but it ended up being a fantastic chance to get my hands dirty with all sorts of software, everything from websites to embedded systems to data warehouses. I ended up staying a couple of years, leaving for awhile, and then coming back.

Eventually, my career in software led me away from Ohio, and Raleigh is our home now. I can't envision us moving back, but I'm proud to be from Akron, and the city will always be a part of me.

Free-Nets, which provided communities free dial-up access to the Internet via a local phone number, were a [short-lived phenomenon](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvwayd/cleveland-free-net-the-cheap-way-dial-up-users-got-online) which originated from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.

Ironically, the model wasn't that dissimilar to cloud computing, just for industrial computation.
