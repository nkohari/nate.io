{% lead-in %}After four and a half years{% /lead-in %}, today was my last day at Stripe.

In May of 2019, [Stripe announced](https://stripe.com/blog/remote-hub) that their newest engineering hub would be Remote. The very same day, I applied for a job there. If memory serves, I actually applied for an opening for an engineer on the Billing team, but through some quirk of fate, my résumé caught the eye of an engineer working on a team called Developer Experience Products.

The Stripe interview process was arduous but fair, deliberate, and actually kind of fun. {% note #1 /%} Everyone who interviewed me radiated positive energy, and it was instantly contagious. Walking out of the office {% note #2 /%} after my interview loop, I thought I'd done pretty well. I really hoped so, because I also realized that I _really_ wanted this job.

Getting a job at Stripe was a dream come true. Like lots of people in the industry, I'd admired the company for years, and I was incredibly excited to be able to work on developer experience for a company who was already so well-regarded for their developer tools.

I thought I would learn quite a bit from Stripe, but the years I spent there were nothing short of transformative for me as an engineer. It was a masterclass in attention to detail, operational excellence, and always striving to do the best thing for users --- even if it meant doing things the hard way. The people there ended up not being just full of positivity, but also passionate, driven, and staggeringly talented. It really is a unique company.

I don't think anything exemplifies what makes Stripe unique more than one of its [operating principles](https://stripe.com/jobs/culture): _move with urgency and focus_. The best way I can describe it is constantly searching for the highest-leverage things to build, along with a sense of _urgency_ --- not _speed_, not _hurry_, just the sense that we should be constantly moving forward and making things better for users. If you ask me, it's this idea that has made Stripe so successful.

Anyways, by the amount I'm gushing, you can probably tell it was a difficult decision to leave. But, after nearly a decade since I started my last company, I can't resist the siren call of startups anymore. Generative AI feels like a tremendous opportunity to build software which makes people's lives better, and I've decided to start [a company](https://ardent.ai) in the AI space. (More on that soon, but if you're interested in hearing more, feel free to reach out!)

I'm incredibly grateful for my time at Stripe, and I'll always look back on my time there fondly.

{% note #1 %}
It became a personal goal to protect this process at Stripe throughout my time there. As tech companies grow -- and especially during ZIRP when people were hiring as fast as possible -- there's always the temptation to start using something awful like Leetcode, and it was very important to me to help hold back that tide.

R.I.P. 510 Townsend, the most Stripiest of Stripe offices. I never made it to the new office at Oyster Point, so Townsend will always be the headquarters in my mind.
