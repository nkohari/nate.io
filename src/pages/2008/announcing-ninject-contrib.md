<span class='drop-cap'>A few days ago</span>, I accepted the first patch for Ninject, an NLog integration extension by [Ivan Porto Carrero](http://flanders.co.nz/). Ivan subsequently created a couple other extensions for Ninject, and rather than put them directly into the main project, we decided to launch [Ninject Contrib](http://code.google.com/p/ninject-contrib/) to collect contributions from the community.

If you've got any ideas for Ninject extensions, or if you come up with any examples that you'd like to share with the rest of Ninject users, feel free to post your idea in the [Ninject developers group](http://groups.google.com/group/ninject-dev) and I'll set you up with commit access.

Major thanks to Ivan for his contributions, and his excellent [ongoing](http://flanders.co.nz/2008/04/17/ninject-getting-all-the-stuff-youll-need/) [series](http://flanders.co.nz/2008/04/18/ninject-part-2-customizing-your-infrastructure-for-logging/) of Ninject-related articles!
