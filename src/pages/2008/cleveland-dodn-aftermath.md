<span class='drop-cap'>Yesterday, I presented</span> at the first annual [Cleveland Day of .NET](http://www.clevelanddodn.org/) in Beachwood, and it was a fantastic experience. I was able to meet some brilliant people -- although at times it was a little surreal, since I already "knew" them from [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nkohari) and it was like I was meeting them all over again. The presentations that I attended were all excellent, and the conversations in the hallways and at lunch and dinner were even better.

Off the top of my head, it was great to meet: [Dan Hounshell](http://danhounshell.com/blogs/dan/), [Alan Stevens](http://netcave.org/), [Joe Fiorini](http://www.faithfulgeek.org/), [Mike Eaton](http://michaeleatonconsulting.com/blog/), [Leon Gersing](http://www.fallenrogue.com/), [Sarah Dutkiewicz](http://codinggeekette.com/), [John Stockton](http://tocode.blogspot.com/), [Corey Haines](http://www.coreyhaines.com/), and [Brian Prince](http://brianhprince.blogspot.com/). I know that I've forgotten some people from this list, and I'm sorry... the day was really a whirlwind, and my memory is horrible. If I've forgotten you, please post a comment or send me a tweet and I'll make it right! Thanks very much to everyone involved in organizing, sponsoring, and attending the event.

For my first time presenting in front of a larger audience, I felt like it went pretty well. I was admittedly a little intimidated -- although very excited -- when it ended up being standing-room-only during my presentation. Thanks to everyone that came to watch me speak, and I hope you found it useful! Thanks also for the kind words and great feedback afterwards, and a special thanks to [Alan Stevens](http://twitter.com/alanstevens) for "refactoring" the projector when it decided to overheat halfway through. :D

Here are my slides, and you can also download them below:

As promised, a more complex code sample that illustrates some of the principles I discussed in the talk is available to download here. The code sample illustrates some of the more advanced uses of Ninject -- stuff that I never could fit on a Keynote slide. I encourage you to tear it apart and get your hands dirty. The best way to learn the value of IoC is definitely to try it for yourself.
