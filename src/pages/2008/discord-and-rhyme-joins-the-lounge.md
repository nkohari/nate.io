<span class='drop-cap'>Twitter is fantastic</span>, because you can use it to meet some really interesting people. One such person I ran into in the Twitterverse is <a href="http://infozerk.com/averyblog/">James Avery</a>, who runs <a href="http://infozerk.com/thelounge">The Lounge</a>, an internet ad network focused on technology. When he invited me to join the <a href="http://www.infozerk.com/thelounge/rooms/dotnetsp">.NET Small Publishers Room</a>, I was flattered, because I had already subscribed to several of the blogs that were featured there. It's an honor to be featured alongside such auspicious company.

For those that read my blog from the site itself, you'll notice a small ad in the top right corner. For those that read the RSS feed, you won't notice any changes.
