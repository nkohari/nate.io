<span class='drop-cap'>Someone</span> from Microsoft (I’ve forgotten who, sorry!) approached me at ALT.NET Seattle a couple weeks ago and asked some questions about Ninject’s licensing. Ninject is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php), and they expressed concern that they might not be able to get approval to use Ninject on their team inside Microsoft.

To fix this problem, I’d like to announce that both Ninject 1 and 2 are now *dual-licensed* under the existing Apache License and the [Microsoft Public License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ms-pl.html). The licenses are essentially identical, but the Ms-PL contains an additional clause intended for patent protection.

So, what does this mean for existing Ninject users? **_Absolutely nothing!_**

_Ninject is and will always be open source_, and you can continue to use it in the same way you always have. However, if you’ve ever tried to advocate the use of Ninject in you company only to have management or your legal department shoot you down, you can now say it’s available under a Microsoft-approved open source license.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to comment or post on the [Ninject user group](http://groups.google.com/group/ninject).
