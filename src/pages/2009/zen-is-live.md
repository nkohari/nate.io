<span class='drop-cap'>It's been about a year</span> since the ideas for [Zen](http://agilezen.com/) started to gel in my mind. After more long nights and working weekends than I can count, I’m proud to announce that Zen is open to the public! I’d like to thank everyone for their support, especially those that tinkered with the product during the beta process – your feedback was absolutely invaluable.

I’d also like to extend a special thanks to [James Avery](http://averyblog.com/), [Mike Eaton](http://mjeaton.net/blog/), [Jayme Davis](http://twitter.com/jaymed), and [Sean Chambers](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/sean_chambers/). They not only used the application since the days of the first alpha, but also through their constant heckling, convinced me to work on it in the first place, and helped me [through the dip](http://averageisforlosers.com/) to get the product to launch.

Finally, I’d like to thank my beautiful and brilliant wife, [Nicole](http://nikibeth.com/), for signing up to ride this rollercoaster with me. I couldn’t do it without you.

So what are you waiting for? Go [sign up](http://agilezen.com/signup) for Zen! :)
