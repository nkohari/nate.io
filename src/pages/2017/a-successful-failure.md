<span class='drop-cap'>I like to think</span> of our first startup, AgileZen, as a "succesful failure". We built a good product, developed a solid customer base, and became profitable. Then we sold the company to Rally Software, which benefited Niki and I personally, but would end up destroying the product.

Lots of people have asked what happened. That’s a question with an incredibly complex answer, requiring a lot of context to understand, but here’s part of the story.

## Bad Moon Rising

By now it was spring of 2012, and some people at Rally were starting to question our tactics.
We were heads-down working on Rubicon, and hadn't shipped many meaningful improvements to
the existing AgileZen platform for several months. While we were doing good work on the new
version, our apparent lack of progress had started to attract attention.

In terms of both expenses and revenue, we were barely a rounding error for the company, and
no one had asked us to change anything we were doing. However, there was another project
called *Rally XE (Express Edition)* &mdash; essentially a stripped-down version of Rally's
core product &mdash; that was starting to gather support.

We'd spent two years trying to convince Rally that no matter how many features you stripped
out and how much complexity you hid away, their core product simply wasn't suited for
small teams. Niki valiantly tried a dozen different ways of explaining to a dozen different
groups of people that AgileZen was best positioned as a strong standalone alternative to
Rally's core product.

The trouble was, we were essentially competing against the core product. When salespeople
listed "AgileZen" on their loss reports, it would cause a shitstorm. [...]

All along, Rally wanted to execute a *land-and-expand* strategy. The idea is that a couple
of small teams in a large organization start using your product, and once a critical mass is
built, you approach executive leadership and sell them a unified license.

The trouble was that the two products represented entirely different ways of thinking,
solving similar problems in very different ways. Rally was originally created to support
a strict Agile workflow, and AgileZen was designed to be free-form and customizable.
Many of our customers were non-technical, and Rally was designed specifically for software
teams. No matter what kind of bridge we could build between them, we didn’t think users
would be interested in crossing it. It’d be like buying a bicycle and then upgrading it
to a Boeing 747.

## It All Falls Apart

In May of 2012, there was a week-long meeting scheduled between us and the people
working on Rally XE. Ostensibly, we were supposed to be finding a way to work together
to share information and resources, but it quickly became clear that the XE team
wanted us to abandon the new version of AgileZen and merge our team with theirs.

Obviously, this wasn't something we were particularly interested in doing. Compared
to what we were using on the new version of Zen, the technology they were using was
outdated and uninteresting. Our users were very engaged and positive about Zen,
and user experience was very important to us. In contrast, the ALM was more... let's say,
*function over form*. While the intent of XE was to create a more user-friendly interface,
we felt strongly that the inherent complexity of their approach could never appeal
to small teams in the way Zen could.

The day before the XE meetings began, Niki and I met with the vice presidents of Engineering
and Product, and I asked a very pointed question: "Is XE the only option available to us,
or can we continue working on the new version of AgileZen?" They assured us that the
company wanted us to do whatever we were most passionate about, and that they would
support our decision.

Buoyed by their assurances, we went into the XE meeting with a defensive stance. We said
we didn't believe their strategy would be successful, and we weren't interested in abandoning
AgileZen to work on it. The meeting was difficult, and got personal. They thought (rightly)
that we didn't want to work with them, and I was tired of having to repeatedly justify
ourselves to them.

True or not, I felt that they didn't understand what they were trying to do, and that they
didn't care about it the way Niki and I did. This was just their day job, but for us,
AgileZen was nearly our entire life. Throughout the meeting, I became more and more blunt
and uncooperative, and finally in exasperation, said "You can do whatever you want to
with AgileZen, but you'll do it without me."

They decided to take me up on my offer. The meetings ended Friday, and the following Monday
the CEO flew out from Boulder and invited me to breakfast, where he fired me.

After Rally let me go, Niki left the AgileZen team. The rest of the team did a commendable
job of trying to pick up the torch, but they were never able to fully realize what we set
out to do. They shipped a beta version of the new Zen, but by then the team had started
to break apart. In October of 2013, they announced that the new version was going to be shelved.
To my knowledge, the XE team built their product, but after being unsuccessful at gaining
traction, it was also canceled.

## Picking up the Pieces

I used to be very angry about what happened, but my emotions have softened over time.
I think that everyone was acting in good faith, trying to solve problems the way they felt
was best. I realize now that it was simply an intractable situation. Everyone has their
breaking point and I had been operating far past mine for far too long. Trust and respect
had been broken down between us and the rest of teh company, and at a certain point,
nothing could be done to repair it.

In retrospect, trying to rewrite our product and invent new technology was probably
not the right decision. It's easy to say that now, but hindsight is always clearer
than foresight. I’m sure that isn’t why Rally let me go, but the fact that we hadn’t
shipped meaningful functionality for a long time made it harder to defend what we
were doing.

If I had known the rules of the game were going to change halfway through, I never
would have made the choices I made, but at the time it seemed like we had a good
chance to pull it off. We’ve never been the type to shy away from hard problems,
and we believed in the potential of what we were trying to do.

In the end, it was an invaluable experience, and it did nothing less than reshape the
way I think about work and life. So many software jobs are just rote and boring, and
the most difficult thing you need to do on a daily basis is stay motivated. Together,
the AgileZen team tried to do something different, something hard. We failed in ways
we didn’t expect, but we did so on our own terms. At Adzerk, I was fortunate to be
able to hire two of the engineers that worked with us on AgileZen. We've all since
moved on to other jobs, but I hope to have the good fortune of working with them
again someday.

Honestly, the most frustrating part is that we were never able to solve the problem
of helping small teams manage their work. So many teams suffer with this, and yet no
one has stepped up with a solution that truly addresses it.
