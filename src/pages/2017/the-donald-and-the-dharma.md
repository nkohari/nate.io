<span class='drop-cap'>I stared hazily</span> at the blue glow of the television. I'd been drinking a little. Actually, I'd been drinking a lot. As the evening dragged on, things were getting more and more blurry, and not just the television picture.

I was watching the returns of the presidential election, and they'd just called Michigan. At this point, it was brutally obvious that Donald Trump was going to be 45th President of the United States.

Fumbling for the remote, I turned off the television, then sat back in my chair and rubbed my eyes.

Earlier that morning, Niki and I had walked down the street to the nearby church that served as our polling place and done our civic duty. I'd been glued to the television pretty much since we got home, waiting for exit polls and then the actual returns.

Like pretty much everyone else, I was convinced that it would be a strong victory for Hillary Clinton. I had my reservations about Clinton, but her politics were reasonably aligned with mine, and I admired her ability to succeed in a role which is dominated by men. I was also pretty convinced that Donald Trump was a narcissitic lunatic that at best would be completely inept, and at worst would be the first truly fascist president in American history. It was obvious who to vote for, and to me, it was obvious who would win.

And, like pretty much everyone else, I couldn't believe what was happening as the votes were tallied and the talking heads called state after state for Trump.
