I recently changed jobs. For the last few years my career trajectory has been a little out of the norm:

2009: We started a startup
2010: Our startup was acquired
2012: I joined my friend's company as CTO
2014: We started another startup
2016: We gave up on the startup and I started a consulting business
2018: I joined one of my consulting clients full-time

As a result, I haven't really _interviewed_ for a job for about 10 years. I've been on the opposite side of the table as a hiring manager, but I haven't been a candidate in a long time. A lot has changed, and I wanted to share my experience.

First, some context: I've been doing this software thing for a long time. I graduated summa cum laude with a BS in Computer Science. I have 15 years of professional experience, including roles as a software engineer, architect, engineering manager, and CTO of a ~15 person company. I've started three companies (two product startups and a consulting practice). I've spoken at conferences. My open source work has been used by thousands of people and earned industry awards. My GitHub profile has reams and reams of code which I've made public over the years.

Anyways, you get the picture. I've been around the block more than once. I'm certainly not claiming to be the best engineer in the world, but I have a proven track record of delivering quality software.

## Company 1: Bay Area Startup (Series B, \$50M funding, ~50 people)

This one started out promising, since I had a warm intro to one of their co-founders. They were interested in expanding from the Bay Area to Raleigh. They had quite a few job openings available, so I submitted an open application. After talking with their (internal) recruiter, we agreed on a job (head of an engineering division) that sounded like a good fit.

The first step was a one-hour live coding exercise via Coderpad. The interviewer's demeanor was cold and disinterested, and incredibly off-putting. They were clearly working on something else during the exercise; they kept forgetting to mute to hide their keyboard clicks. The exercise itself wasn't difficult; it just required breaking down the problem into composite pieces and solving them individually.

My performance on the exercise being adequate, they asked me to fly to California for an on-site interview. I live on the east coast, so between the flight time and the time zone difference, a single day on-site really means three days of travel. I still had a full-time job, so that meant taking three days of PTO. Also, our son is less than a year old and my wife also works full-time, so if I'm traveling it means a lot more work for her. But okay, you've gotta do what you've gotta do. I would fly out Wednesday and back Friday.

When I showed up to the office, it seemed like no one even knew I was coming. The door was locked, so I signed in to Envoy on the iPad as requested. After standing in the hallway for about 15 minutes, an employee of the company happened to come off the elevator and asked if I was waiting. I explained I was here to interview, and they let me in to sit in the lobby for another 10 minutes.

I spent the next six hours in a series of interviews. I got the impression that none of the interviewers had seen my resume or knew what job I was interviewing for. I spent at least a quarter of the time explaining my experience, which was already explained my resume. With a couple of exceptions, everyone was either disinterested or clearly enjoying the position of power.

I flew back home Friday morning. Radio silence until the following Friday, when I finally gave in and nudged the recruiter via email. He asked me to call, and told me that they weren't interested in making an offer.

**Investment:** ~8 hours of interviews, 3 days of travel
**Result:** No offer

## Company 2: Local Startup (Series Seed, \$5M funding, ~10 people)

Founder and CEO posted their interest to a local developers Slack in hiring engineers.

During first call, the founder openly criticized the fact that a lot of my experience is in productivity software. Productivity software, they said, is ugly and complex, and they were going for an "Instagram-level user experience".

Met with their head of engineering, whose title was (confusingly) Co-Founder and Principal Engineer. Later realized that although there is one Founder and three Co-Founders (?), only the Founder and CEO has a C-level title.

Head of engineering asked me to do a take-home exercise. I agreed, but given the time investment I wanted to get some clarity around compensation first. Their maximum budget for the role was a reasonable salary for an engineer, but would result in me taking a \$35K paycut.

I was still interested, because their product is pretty compelling. They also seemed very strong in the engineering specialization required for their product, but light in terms of application development. They wanted someone to lead out the construction of a React app, which is squarely in my wheelhouse. They were very well-funded for a seed-stage startup, and seemed like they were hiring aggressively. The head of engineering also specifically said that they were looking for someone with leadership experience, so I felt like the role could grow into a leadership opportunity. I asked for some clarity around where they thought the role would grow in the future.

I got radio silence for the next two days, during which I continued working on the take-home exercise. Finally, after another email nudge, the head of engineering replied to say that they didn't see me as an engineering leader, but as an individual contributor. Between "my focus on title and management growth" and my "perception that I'll be receiving pay cut" they weren't interested in continuing.

A couple of things:

1. It wasn't a _perception_ that it was a pay cut. Math is math, and the salary they were offering was \$35K less per year than I was making.
2. If they only wanted me to be an IC, I'm definitely not the right fit. However, startups grow fast, and engineers who are capable of leadership are incredibly valuable.

I appreciate them being clear about the lack of growth potential in the role. In my experience it's incredibly shortsighted... but honestly, between this and the odd founder structure, it seems like they might have some organizational dysfunction about sharing authority.

**Investment:** ~2 hours of interviews, ~10 hours on take-home exercise
**Result:** No offer

## Company 3: Local Startup (Series A, \$3M funding, ~20 people)

## Company 4: Bay Area Startup (Series C, \$120M funding, ~200 people)

Responded cold to job posting for a Principal Engineer.

One hour call with Director of Engineering.

Spent 8 hours on a sample exercise. It was a reasonably simple problem, but it's important to me that I deliver real software, so I set up a monorepo, shipped a version to Heroku, the whole smash.

Another one hour call with Director. During the call, they asked me to write a function that printed stars to the console using recursion instead of iteration. Keep in mind at this point I've already delivered working software. I have no idea what new signal the recursion-printing exercise would generate.

**Investment:** ~2 hours of interviews, ~8 hours on take-home exercise
**Result**: Dropped out

## Company 5: Public Corporation (Public, \$100B+ market cap, 30,000+ people)

Warm intro from an ex-manager.

## Company 6: NYC Startup (Series F, \$350M funding, ~700 people)

Warm intro from a colleague.

## Company 7: Bay Area Startup (Series E, \$800M funding, ~2,000 people)
