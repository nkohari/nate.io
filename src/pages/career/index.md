NOTE! This still needs a bit of work. For now, check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/nkohari) instead.

Since I began my career in 2004, I've held pretty much every role in the software development cycle, including developer, architect, manager, and executive. These days, I'm working as a consultant, primarily in React and Node.js.
